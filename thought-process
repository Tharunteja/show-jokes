1. Describe the thought process regarding the folder structure.
    I've used angular-cli to create the project, since it has got some in built folder structure by default.
    Created services folder so that all the services within the app can be placed in it and is easily accessible.
    Created interface called jokes.interface.ts within app folder to get the right typed data.

2. Describe the thought process behind creating the service.
    To maintain all the API calls and to handle other functionalities created jokes.service.ts file within
    services folder, and injected this service at the root so that this can be used throughout the application,
